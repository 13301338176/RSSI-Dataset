# RSSI-Dataset

The RSSI-Dataset  provides a comprehensive set of Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) readings from within two indoor office buildings. Four wireless technologies were used: 
 - Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4), 
 - WiFi (IEEE 802. 11), 
 - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and 
 - Long Range Area-Wide Network (LoRaWAN). 
 
 For experimentation  Arduinos Raspberry Pi, XBees, Gimbal beacons Series 10 and Dragino LoRa Shield were also used. Â 

# Experiment

A set of tests is conducted  to test how accurate the localization will be when performed at both near and far distances between the receiver and transmitters for all the indoor systems. All experiments were conducted in the evening once a majority of individuals had left to ensure that minimal interference would be caused by other devices that are attempting to transmit using the same medium. Due to the fact that RSSI values are prone to interference, using a controlled environment would allow all the tests performed to produce more consistent readings. 

Overall, nine tests were performed in each of the environments. A variety of distances were used along with multiple receiver locations to determine the accuracy of the wireless technologies. A general overview of the experimental setup created can be seen in
